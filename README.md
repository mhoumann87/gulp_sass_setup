# Basic Setup For Development with SASS

---

A simple boilerplate set up for a HTML project, using SASS with [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/) to compile the scss into css.

---

Simply clone or download this repository and run
```
npm install
```
in your terminal.

To start the compiling just run
```
gulp
```
in your terminal.

---

The files are setup to take the scss from main.scss and compile it to the main.css file in the css folder.

If you import all the others scss files in the main.scss like this
```scss
@import 'variables'
```
then all your scss will be compiled.
